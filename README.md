# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview:
The PyBer Challenge provides ridesharing visualization for PyBer in order to promote ride-sharing services to under-privileged areas. The data was retrived from CSV files containing data about the city type, amount of rides and payments, and dates which, in turn, was analyzed in Jupyter notebook using Python Pandas.
## Results:
*Fig 1: Total Fare by City Type*

The figure above shows how much money was spent by which city type. There is an even intake of profits across the chart from January to May. Urban is the most grossing, while rural is much less.

Urban performs the best by a large margin when it comes to total fares. However, rural tends to have higher cost fares per ride/driver. With Urban having over double the amount of drivers, and not enough rides to satiate the number, rural has more than enough rides for drivers comparatively as with Suburban.

## Conclusions:
  1. Urban cities have better profits
  2. The cost of rides is higher where there is less demand and drivers.
  3. The rural areas have a higher fare than urban or suburban rides

## Suggestions:
  1. Expanding the data set will enhance the assumptions made from the data. We may see more rides during the holidays or during certain times of the year.
  2. Reassess the demand in rural cities and evaluate the needs of the drivers, the fares, and the customers as with less drivers, the fare is much higher.
  3. The amount of drivers should decrease in the urban city due to over-saturation of the city type.
  4. The study needs to include distance in its data points. Distance may metric if rural areas have higher fares due to longer trips.
